Hello World;
As an old school hardware design engineer, I know just enough about programming to "mess up a really good program".
My first programming experiance was with a COMMODORE PET. We bought it to do our invoicing and billing. My programming time was limited to having to be at work so I purchasede a VIC20 for home (then a 64). In the end, it all worked out.
COMMODORE BASIC lead to TRS80 BASIC and finally to MS QB-4.5 (which i still use today:-)
THEN Motorola released the 68000 and I received a free designers kit. Machine code from my days on the PDP 8/11 were much easier to understand and the transition to ASSEMBLY went very well.
HERE TELL - "C" programming language. "ALL YOU WILL EVER NEED TO LEARN" Was unable to locate a list of the command set. Did not understand unlimited variable names with lower and upper case letters. And "VOID"??? if the A register has $00, there's "NOTHING" there... 
THEN not only "C" but "C+1" (lol) Oh My Golly! I'm surrounded! Everyone was right - it's everywhere... Sooooooo... C/C++ FOR DUMMIES! (i'm too stupid to be a dummie!)
A light at the end of the tunnel! I do BASIC - VISUAL BASIC 5.0 LEARNING EDITION! VB was not very intuitive for me. (like teaching pig latin to someone who only speaks GREEK) I guess that QB45 must be burried in there SOMEWHERE... I never found it!!!
A new VISUAL BASIC - HORRAY!!! so I tried VB 6.0 LEARNING EDITION! Now there are TWO holes in the boat...
And then: ARDUINO! My designer kit sat on the shelf for 2 years before I was willing to give "C/C++" another look. Stumbeling around in the dark, tripping on everything, walking into thing, I made a HUGE discovery. Many of the commands in this "C" language are VERY SIMILIAR to QB45, but the epiphany is, like in QB45, if you type the command and then click the help button, it shows the syntax and coding examples!!! HALLELUJAH!!!

now you're up to date! :-)
